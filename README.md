Schema validation
==============

This is a small automation system to help with automation testing of XML Schemas. The idea is to validate that a schema was defined to support whatever are the business requirements. What values might endup in the XML file.
The principle is simple, use an XML file that passes schema validation, start from a valid premises. You update the file content with whatever you you think should and should not be accepted.
